# SwaggerAPI

My Rest-Assured solo project. Will work on all APIs mentioned in [SwaggerAPI.](https://demoqa.com/swagger/#/) 
1. Rest-Assured
2. TestNG
3. AventStack for pretty html report
4. Maven for build
5. Jenkins
6. Google Spreadsheet for test document.

**Update 1 (April 21st 2022)**

Following the setup i've made on [SeleniumFramework](https://github.com/ikhszy/seleniumFramework), i've managed to setup the jenkins as well. Will continue with the test document when i have the time (doing this everyday enraged my wife ðŸ˜‰)

Update 2 (May 3rd 2022)

i have created the [test document as can be seen here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jX6kiUB9mw8t7c-hpTUjCbH7zfwlytzVdMvs6DPQdI8/edit?usp=sharing) (Commenter access only). Feel free to comment on the test doc. Will continue on the doc for a while until i deemed the doc is enough to continue with another automation.
